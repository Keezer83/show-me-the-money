# Summary

This project was a fun next step for DOM manipulation and adding items, in this case, table rows, to an already existing element. It was a natural next step from the To-Do app. I enjoyed finding a simple use case for a JavaScript object with data to be used for setting values and calling them into a function.

The CSS is still challenging, and I found several CSS styles through online searches to try out. These are largely experimental, and I am trying to build my understanding of how those styles are built and how they can be applied.

I still used borders around the different element tags to build out my understanding of which components of a page will get what styles and in what order. This is a growing discipline and one I am working on so as to come up with more opportunities to style naturally and not always through examples and searching sources.
